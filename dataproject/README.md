# Dataproject

This data project addresses the development of home care for people aged 65 years and above in Denmark.

An API is used to fetch data from tabel AED06, AED12 and FOLK02 from Statistics Denmark. 

Our repository only consist of one file 'Data-project-MEC-done.ipynb' and it will be the only file necessary to run the project. The project should be self-expanatory when reading the notebook.
