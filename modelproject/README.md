# Modelproject

In this project, we used the the standard static labour supply model. 

In the first part, the model is presented and the set up explained. The model is solved theoretically and analytically, where the solutions are shown to be the same. Thereafter, the model is solved by using numerical optimisation and the chosen algorithm  is called a sequential (least-squares) quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm (SLSQP). We choose this algorithm as one of our extensions includes a non-linear constraint. The results are that C = 1266.69 and L = 16.89. Further, we visualize the results for different values of the wage rate. 

In the second part, we extended the model by including a proportional income tax. The results are that C = 906.61 and L = 17.27. 

In the third part, we extended the model by including a progressive income tax, and the results are that C = 1099.99 and L = 18.00.
